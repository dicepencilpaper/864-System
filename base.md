# Spells & Steel
A super simplified concept for a medieval fantasy role-playing system
by Dice Pencil & Paper

## Basics
To use this system, we need the following dice: d8, d6, and d4. These will always be rolled in the following ways:

* Only d8
* Roll d8 + d6
* Roll d8 + d6 + d4

The result values will always be added up as a total, together with any modifiers (as explained below).

### Solving tasks
Every task will have three difficulty levels, and each level has its own dice to roll:

* Easy: d8 + d6 + d4
* Average: d8 + d6
* Hard: d8

To determine if an action to perform a task is successful, the player needs to roll as number equal or greater than 8. It is up to the Game Master to determine the difficulty of a task generally. Tasks include skill actions and activities, and also includes combat actions.

## Player characters
Player characters will have 1d4+1 skills available, based on the setting the game is being played on. A player will roll to see how many skills they have available. Let's create a character as an example!

### Skills
The player rolls 1d4 and gets 3 + 2 = five initial skills. They want to play a sort of wilderness-savvy fighter, so these are the skills chosen:

* Swordsmanship
* Bows
* Hunting
* Tracking
* Herbalist

By having these skills, they get one difficulty level bump when using these skills. If a task required a hard skill roll, it now becomes average. Average becomes easy, and easy difficulty tasks are automatically successful, meaning that no roll is needed.

### Hit points
A player character will have a total amount of 10 hit points.

## Combat
To determine the difficulty level to hit an entity, we need to check if that entity is trained in combat or has any sort of natural combat ability (as in a monster). If the target of the attack has no combat abilities, the roll to hit them is average. If the entity has some training or natural capability, the roll is a hard one. This is modified by the attacker having any skills in the weapon or attack being executed. This can be explained in the following table.

|                    | Defender skilled | Defender unskilled |
|--------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Attacker skilled   | Average          | Easy               |
| Attacker unskilled | Hard             | Average            |

### Weapons
Each weapon has a number bonus for their to-hit number, meaning that bonus is added to the total of the dice rolled.

| Weapon             | Bonus |
|--------------------|-------|
| Battle axe         | +2    |
| Dagger             | +1    |
| Great axe          | +4    |
| Hand axe           | +1    |
| Longbow            | +3    |
| Longsword          | +3    |
| Shortbow           | +2    |
| Shortsword         | +2    |
| Sling              | +1    |
| Two-handed sword   | +4    |

### Armor
Armor reduces the damage taken from an attack. This factor is known as a protection rating (PR). 

| Armor         | PR |
|---------------|----|
| Chain mail    | 2  |
| Leather       | 1  |
| Plate mail    | 3  |

Shields reduce the chance of being hit by an attack.

| Shield type   | Mod |
|---------------|-----|
| Large         | -3  |
| Small         | -2  |

### Damage
Damage is equal to the difference between the attack roll minus 8. For example, a chainmail-clad warrior attacks with his longsword a barbarian wearing leather armor and armed with a great axe. Both have fighting skills, so all rolls will be average. The warrior rolls 10, + 3 from her longsword for a total of 13, which is higher than 8 so it hits. Damage should be 13 - 8 = 6, but the barbarian's leather armor reduces that to 5. Now the barbarian has only 5 hit points left.

## Magic
Magic-users have a total of
