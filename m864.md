# 864 System
The 864 is a simplified tabletop role-playing system uses the d8, d6, and d4 dice for its mechanics. It uses dice elimination and simple modifiers to set up roll targets and determine success.

## Entities
An entity is defined as a player character, non-player character, monster, creature, or any other sentient or semi-sentient inhabitant of the adventure world, basically anything that can be considered alive (or pseudo-alive, like undead creatures).

### Abilities
Abilities define global characteristics of any sentient or semi-sentient entity. These are defined by how many dice are rolled when using them, and have three levels for measuring how capable the entity is in that area.

| Rating  | Dice         |
|---------|--------------|
| High    | d8 + d6 + d4 |
| Average | d8 + d6      |
| Low     | d8           |

<!--Since there are only three levels per each ability, the initial recommendation is to have multiple abilities used in the entity definition so that a lot of ground can be covered and compensate for the somewhat simple ability measurement system. These are some proposed abilities:-->

#### Acumen (ACU)
Measures the ability for reasoning and understanding, and for things such as investigation and research. <!--This  determines how many skills an entity can know.-->

#### Agility (AGI)
Measures physical nimbleness, hand-to-eye coordination and precise handiwork. Use this ability as the base for missile attacks.

#### Strength (STR)
Measures raw physical strength and power. Melee attacks would use this stat as their base.

#### Tenacity (TEN)

Measures the entity's mental strength and resilience, and also sets how much mental damage the entity can take.

### Ability Modifiers

Ability modifiers are used to determine the value of additional stats. Elements in the game can change the modifiers up or down thereby changing any of the additional stats. 

| Rating | Roll         | Odd Result | Even Result |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| High   | d8 + d6 + d4 | +1         | +2          |
| Low    | d8           | -1         | -2          |

The ability modifier for an ability with Average rating is 0.

### Additional stats

There are other stats that are needed to round out the basic description for an entity.

#### Mental attack target (MAT)
Determines the base difficulty to hit the entity with a mental/psych attack. To determine this stat, add 8 to the ability modifiers of Acumen and Tenacity abilities. The result is the base number someone needs to roll (or higher) to affect the entity via a mental or psych attack. For example, a player character with low awareness -1 and average acumen would have -1 + 0 + 8 = 7. An opponent would need to roll 7 or more to be affect the character.

Talismans or Mnemonics can increase or decrease the MAT of an entity.

#### Mental damage resistance (MDR)
Determines how much physical damage the entity can take. To determine this stat, add 4 to the Tenacity ability modifier.

Crystals or Elixirs can increase or decrease the MDR of an entity.

#### Physical attack target (PAT)
Determines how easy or difficult it is to hit the entity with a physical attack. To determine this stat, add 8 to the ability modifiers of the Agility and Strength abilities .The result is the base number someone needs to roll (or higher) to hit the entity with a physical attack. For example, a player character with high agility (+1) and high awareness (+2) would have 1 + 2 + 8 = 11 or more to be hit.

Armor or Cover can increase the PAT on an entity.

#### Physical damage resistance (PDR)
Determines how much physical damage the entity can take. To determine this ability, add 4 to the Strength ability modifier.

Medicines can increase the PDR of an entity while Poisons can decrease PDR.

## Skills

Skills represent broad categories of learned abilities. There are five: Survival, Communication, Knowledge, Subterfuge, and Physical. 

**Communication**: The Communication skill represents tasks that involve passing information to another entity through word, sign language, scents, braille, or other means.

**Education**: The Education skill represents tasks that present knowledge gained through instruction or experience.

**Somatic**: The Somatic skill represents tasks that use the physical body. Often this would pertain to athletic actions.

**Subterfuge**: The Subterfuge skill represents tasks that involve deception, misdirection, or sneakiness.

**Survival**: The Survival skill represents outdoor or wilderness tasks such as finding North, foraging, hunting, setting snares, tracking, and finding rare herbs or water. It can also reference urban tasks such as finding a place to sleep in addition to tracking and foraging.

Each skill has the rank of 0, 1, or 2. A rank of zero represents no training or experience with a skill. A rank of one represents proficiency of a skill. A rank of two represents mastery of a skill. An entity can be proficient with up to three skills, but may only attain mastery of one. An entity is required to have a rank of zero in at least two skills.

Entities are likely to have two or more skills with a rank of zero.

## Base mechanics

Performing any kind of action with a chance for failure requires a roll based on an ability and a skill value against a target number from 1 to 20. The higher the number, the more difficult the action.

## Combat

Damage - PDR make potential for wounds.

If Damage - PDR is between 1 and 4, -1 to attack rolls.

If Damage - PDR is between 5 and 8, -1 to attack rolls and something else

If Damage - PDR is greater than 8, one wound per multiple of 4 left over.
