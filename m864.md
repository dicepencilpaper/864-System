# 864 System
The 864 is a simplified tabletop role-playing system uses the d8, d6, and d4 dice for its mechanics. It uses dice elimination and simple modifiers to set up roll targets and determine success.

## Entities
An entity is defined as a player character, non-player character, monster, creature, or any other sentient or semi-sentient inhabitant of the adventure world, basically anything that can be considered alive (or pseudo-alive, like undead creatures).

### Abilities
Abilities define global characteristics of any sentient or semi-sentient entity. These are defined by how many dice are rolled when using them, and have three levels for measuring how capable the entity is in that area.

| Rating  | Dice         |
|---------|--------------|
| High    | d8 + d6 + d4 |
| Average | d8 + d6      |
| Low     | d8           |

Since there are only three levels per each ability, the initial recommendation is to have multiple abilities used in the entity definition so that a lot of ground can be covered and compensate for the somwhat simple ability measurement system. These are some proposed abilities:

#### Acumen (ACU)
Measures the ability for reasoning and understanding, and for things such as investigation and research. This determines how many skills an entity can know.

#### Agility (AGI)
Measures physical nimbleness, hand-to-eye coordination and precise handiwork. Use this ability as the base for missile attacks.

#### Strength (STR)
Measures raw physical strength and power. Melee attacks would use this stat as their base.

#### Tenacity (TEN)

Measures the entity's mental strength and resilience, and also sets how much mental damage the entity can take.

### Ability Modifiers

Ability modifiers are used to determine the value of additional stats. Elements in the game can change the modifiers up or down thereby changing any of the additional stats. 

| Rating | Roll         | Odd Result | Even Result |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| High   | d8 + d6 + d4 | +1         | +2          |
| Low    | d8           | -1         | -2          |

The ability modifier for an ability with Average rating is 0.

### Additional stats

There are other stats that are needed to round out the basic description for an entity.

#### Mental attack target (MAT)
Determines how easy or difficult it is to hit the entity with a mental/psych attack. To determine this stat, add 8 to the ability modifiers of Acumen and Tenacity abilities. The result is the base number someone needs to roll (or higher) to affect the entity via a mental or psych attack. For example, a player character with low awareness -1 and average acumen would have -1 + 0 + 8 = 7. An opponent would need to roll 7 or more to be affect the character.

#### Mental damage resistance (MDR)
Determines how much physical damage the entity can take. To determine this stat, add 4 to the Tenacity ability modifier.

#### Physical attack target (PAT)
Determines how easy or difficult it is to hit the entity with a physical attack. To determine this stat, add 8 to the ability modifiers of the Agility and Strength abilities .The result is the base number someone needs to roll (or higher) to hit the entity with a physical attack. For example, a player character with high agility (+1) and high awareness (+2) would have 1 + 2 + 8 = 11 or more to be hit.

#### Physical damage resistance (PDR)
Determines how much physical damage the entity can take. To determine this ability, add 4 to the Strength ability modifier.

## Talents

Talents represent special abilities an entity possess such as a connection to magic, super powers, or other extraordinary abilities.
