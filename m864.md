# 864 System
The 864 is a simplified tabletop role-playing system uses the d8, d6, and d4 dice for its mechanics. It uses dice elimination and simple modifiers to set up roll targets and determine success.

## Entities
An entity is defined as a player character, non-player character, monster, creature, or any other sentient or semi-sentient inhabitant of the adventure world, basically anything that can be considered alive (or pseudo-alive, like undead creatures).

### Abilities
Abilities define global characteristics of any sentient or semi-sentient entity. These are defined by how many dice are rolled when using them, and have three levels for measuring how capable the entity is in that area.

| Rating  | Dice         |
|---------|--------------|
| High    | d8 + d6 + d4 |
| Average | d8 + d6      |
| Low     | d8           |

Since there are only three levels per each ability, the initial recommendation is to have multiple abilities used in the entity definition so that a lot of ground can be covered and compensate for the somwhat simple ability measurement system. These are some proposed abilities:

#### Acumen (ACU)
Measures the ability for reasoning and understanding, investigation and research abilities and the entity's mental strength and resilience. This determines how many skills an entity can know.

#### Agility (AGI)
Measures physical nimbleness, hand-to-eye coordination and precise handiwork. Use this ability as the base for missile attacks.

#### Endurance (END)
Measures toughness and resistance to damage. This directly determines how much damage an entity can take.

#### Strength (STR)
Measures raw physical strength and power. Melee attacks would use this stat as their base.

### Additional stats
There are other stats that are needed to round out the basic description for an entity.

#### Mental attack target (MAT)
Determines how easy or difficult it is to hit the entity with a mental/psych attack. To determine this stat, consult the Acument and Tenacity scores. Add them up using the following reference values:

| Rating  | Modifier |
|---------|----------|
| High    | +2       |
| Average | 0        |
| Low     | -2       |

Take 8 and add the values of both abilities. The result is the base number someone needs to roll (or higher) to affect the entity via a mental or psych attack. For example, a player character with low awareness and average acumen would have -2 + 0 + 8 = 6 or more to be affected.

#### Mental damage resistance (MDR)
Determines how much physical damage the entity can take. This is defined as follows, based on the Tenacity ability:

| Rating  | Score |
|---------|-------|
| High    | 6     |
| Average | 4     |
| Low     | 2     |

#### Physical attack target (PAT)
Determines how easy or difficult it is to hit the entity with a physical attack. To determine this stat, consult the Agility and Awareness scores. Add them up using the following reference values:

| Rating  | Modifier |
|---------|----------|
| High    | +2       |
| Average | 0        |
| Low     | -2       |

Take 8 and add the values of both abilities. The result is the base number someone needs to roll (or higher) to hit the entity with a physical attack. For example, a player character with high agility and average awareness would have 2 + 0 + 8 = 10 or more to be hit.

#### Physical damage resistance (PDR)
Determines how much physical damage the entity can take. This is defined as follows, based on the Endurance ability:

| Rating  | Score |
|---------|-------|
| High    | 6     |
| Average | 4     |
| Low     | 2     |

## Base mechanics
All attempts at performing an action will be performed against a target number from 1 to 20. The higher the number, the more difficult the action is.
