a super simplified concept for a role-playing system
by Dice Pencil & Paper

## Basics

To use this system, we need the following dice: d8, d6, and d4. These will always be rolled in the following ways:

* Only d8
* Roll d8 + d6
* Roll d8 + d6 + d4

The result values will always be added up as a total, together with any modifiers (as explained below).

### Solving tasks

Every task will have three difficulty levels, and each level has its own dice to roll:

* Easy: d8 + d6 + d4
* Average: d8 + d6
* Hard: d8

To determine if an action to perform a task is successful, the player needs to roll as number equal or greater than 8. It is up to the Game Master to determine the difficulty of a task generally. Tasks include skill actions and activities, and also includes combat actions.

## Player characters

Player characters will have 1d4+1 skills available, based on the setting the game is being played on. A player will roll to see how many skills they have available. Let's create a character as an example. For simplicity purposes, we'll be creating this character in a medieval fantasy setting.

### Skills

The player rolls 1d4 and gets 3 + 2 = five initial skills. They want to play a sort of wilderness-savvy fighter, so these are the skills chosen:

* Swordsmanship
* Bows
* Hunting
* Tracking
* Herbalist

By having these skills, they get one difficulty level bump when using these skills. If a task required a hard skill roll, it now becomes average. Average becomes easy, and easy difficulty tasks are automatically successful, meaning that no roll is needed.

### Hit points

A player character will have a total amount of 8 hit points.

## Combat

To determine the difficulty level to hit an entity, we need to check if that entity is trained in combat or has any sort of natural combat ability (as in a monster). If the target of the attack has no combat abilities, the roll to hit them is average. If the entity has some training or natural capability, the roll is a hard one. This is modified by the attacker having any skills in the weapon or attack being executed. This can be explained in the following table.

|                    | Defender skilled | Defender unskilled |
|--------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Attacker skilled   | Average          | Easy               |
| Attacker unskilled | Hard             | Average            |
