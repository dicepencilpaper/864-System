# Referee's Toolbox

A list of resources for referees to use in their games.

## Supers

Extending the abilities from 3 to 8 provides a great way to add supers. Starting with Low, you add 2d6 to each of the 3 Abilities in the regular game and place the stats above High. To add two Abilities below Low, take the die down a level.

### Extended Ability Table

| Rating     | Dice          |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| Unearthly  | d8 + 3d6 + d4 |
| Superhuman | d8 + 3d6      |
| Very High  | d8 + 2d6      |
| High       | d8 + d6 + d4  |
| Average    | d8 + d6       |
| Low        | d8            |
| Very Low   | d6            |
| Weak       | d4            |

If you want to investigate how this works from a probability standpoint, you can look at the anydice link [here](https://anydice.com/program/19ccf). One feature of this dice progression is that the minimum rolls progress upwards, unlike the dice progressions in some d20 systems.

## Fantasy

Spells are provided in the Fantasy 864 game, but not the tools to build your own. Here are the tables to build your own spells.

### Spell Building

The first ingredient used in building the spell is selecting the appropriate talent. A Talent shapes the form of the spell (like Fire Magic) and/or the effect (like Asrtal/Pranic Travel). Using the two example, a Fire Magic spell will always have an element of Fire in it somehow. It could be to provide light or burning energy. Since you can describe the look of a spell in any way you want, a spell that forms a ring of fire allowing you to teleport would not be a Fire Magic spell, but a Gate Magic spell.

If the suggested Talents don't meet the needs, then create a new talent.
