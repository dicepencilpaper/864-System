# Referee's Toolbox

A list of resources for referees to use in their games.

## Distance

**Reach** - Within about five feet.

**Nearby** - Between five feet and about thirty feet.

**Stone's Throw** - Between thirty feet and about sixty feet.

**Yonder** - Between about sixty feet and around 120 feet

**Crossbow Range** - Between 120 and 300 feet

**Longbow Range** - Between 300 and 600 feet

**Far Away** - Anything over 600 feet.

## Combat

Combat follows a sequence:

1. Determine who goes first.

2. Attacker rolls damage of a weapon plus either the Strength plus the rank of the Somatic skill for melee combat or Agility plus the rank of the Somatic skill for ranged combat. If the result is greater than or equal to the target's Physical Attack Target, the attacker is successful.

3. If successful, the difference between the attack roll and the target's PAT is the **degree of success**.

4. The referee compares the degree of success to the Physical Damage Resistance (PDR) stat and adjudicates as follows:

   1. If the degree of success is less then or equal to the PDR, the target is unaffected.
   2. If the degree of success is between 1 and 4 points above the PDR, the target is **harmed**, taking a -1 penalty to their PDR.
   3. If the degree of success is greater than 4 points above the PDR, the target is **wounded** and takes a wound for every 4 points of the degree of success. The target also suffers a -1 penalty to their PDR.

   The -1 penalties are cumulative. If an entity has already been harmed once, they suffer a -1 penalty to their PDR. If they are harmed again, the penalty increases to -2 and if harmed yet again, increases to -3. PDR can be negative.


### Combat Example

Here is a detailed example of how combat works.

A player's entity, named Bart is fighting an animated skeleton with a sword. Bart has average Strength and Physical skill rank of 1. Damage from a sword is 2. His attack rolls will be d8 + d6 + 1 (skill) +2 (sword). The skeleton has High Agility (+1) and Low Strength (-1) making their Physical Attack Target 8 + 1 - 1 or 8. The skeleton's Physical Damage Resistance is 4 - 1 or 3. The skeleton can take 3 wounds before being defeated.

Bart rolls an 8 and adds 3 from the skill rating and weapon damage. The referee compares the result of 11 to the skeleton's PAT. The attack roll is 3 higher, so they declare that the skeleton was hit by Bart's sword. Comparing the degree of success of 3 to the skeleton's PDR of 3 results in no damage. The referee describes that the skeleton shook off the attack.

On the next round, Bart rolls an 11. Adding 3 to the result yield an attack roll of 14. When comparing 14 , the attack roll is 6 more than the skeleton's PAT, a successful hit. Comparing the degree of success of 6 to the skeleton's PDR of 3 results in the the degree of success of 3. The skeleton is hurt. The skeleton's PDR is lowered to 2. The referee describes this a gash in one of the skeleton's leg bones.

On the following round, Bart rolls an 9. Adding 3 to the result yield an attack roll of 12. When comparing 12 , the attack roll is 4 more than the skeleton's PAT, a successful hit. Comparing the degree of success of 4 to the skeleton's PDR of 2 results in the skeleton being hurt. The skeleton's PDR is lowered to 1. 

On the fourth round, Bart rolls a 13. Adding 3 to the result yields an attack roll of 16. The attack roll is 8 more than the skeleton's PAT, a successful hit. Comparing 8 to the skeleton's PDR of 1 results in the skeleton being wounded. The degree of success of is 7. The referee divides 7 by 4 and rounds down. The skeleton suffers 1 wound leaving it 2 wounds remaining before being defeated. The skeleton's PDR is lowered again, now to 0.

## Other Notes

<!--The extended ability table can be used to build spells, weapons, and any other damage-based item. Similar tables will appear below:-->

## Supers

Extending the abilities from 3 to 8 provides a great way to add supers. Starting with Low, you add 2d6 to each of the 3 Abilities in the regular game and place the stats above High. To add two Abilities below Low, take the die down a level.

### Extended Ability Table

| Rating     | Dice          |  Modifier  |
| ---------- | ------------- | :--------: |
| Unearthly  | d8 + 3d6 + d4 | + 7 to + 8 |
| Superhuman | d8 + 3d6      | + 5 to + 6 |
| Very High  | d8 + 2d6      | + 3 to + 4 |
| High       | d8 + d6 + d4  | + 1 to + 2 |
| Average    | d8 + d6       |     0      |
| Low        | d8            | - 1 to - 2 |
| Very Low   | d6            | - 3 to - 4 |
| Weak       | d4            | - 5 to - 6 |

If you want to investigate how this works from a probability standpoint, you can look at the anydice link [here](https://anydice.com/program/19ccf). One feature of this dice progression is that the minimum rolls progress upwards, unlike the dice progressions in some d20 systems.

## Fantasy

Spells are provided in the Fantasy 864 game, but not the tools to build your own. Here are the tables to build your own spells.

### Fantasy Equipment

| Weapon       | Damage |
| ------------ | ------ |
| Dagger       | 1      |
| Handaxe      | 2      |
| Javelin      | 2      |
| Mace         | 2      |
| Quarterstaff | 2      |
| Crossbow     | 3      |
| Longsword    | 3      |
| Shortsword   | 2      |
| Halberd      | 4      |
| Greatsword   | 5      |



### Spell Building

#### First Ingredient: Talent 

A Talent shapes the form of the spell (like Fire Magic) and/or the effect (like Asrtal/Pranic Travel). Using the two example, a Fire Magic spell will always have an element of Fire in it somehow. It could be to provide light or burning energy. Since you can describe the look of a spell in any way you want, a spell that forms a ring of fire allowing you to teleport would not be a Fire Magic spell, but a Gate Magic spell.

If the suggested Talents don't meet the needs, then create a new talent.

#### Second Ingredient: Casting Time

| Time       | Affect |
| ---------- | ------ |
| 10 minutes | + 1    |
| 1 minute   | + 2    |
| 4 actions  | + 3    |
| 2 actions  | + 4    |
| 1 action   | + 5    |

#### Third Ingredient: Range

| Range           | Affect |
| --------------- | ------ |
| Self or Reach   | + 1    |
| Nearby          | + 2    |
| A Stone's Throw | + 3    |
| Yonder          | + 4    |
| Crossbow Range  | + 5    |
| Longbow Range   | + 6    |

#### Fourth Ingredient: Duration

| Duration   | Affect |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Instant    | + 1    |
| 1 minute   | + 2    |
| 10 minutes | + 3    |
| 30 minutes | + 4    |
| 1 hour     | + 5    |

#### Fifth Ingredient: Area of Effect

| # Targets | Area            | Divining                  |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1         | Self/Individual | Attribute Roll in Minutes |
| Up to 2   | Small Room      | Attribute Roll in Hours   |
| Up to 4   | Large Room      | Attribute Roll in Days    |
| Up to 6   | Small House     | Attribute Roll in Weeks   |
| Up to 8   | Large House     | Attribute Roll in Months  |

#### Sixth Ingredient: Effect

| Cost | Damage | Healing                      | Other |
| ---- | ------ | ---------------------------- | ----- |
| 1    | + 1    | Restore PDR                  | +/- 1 |
| 2    | + 2    | 1 Wound or Remove Scar       | +/- 2 |
| 3    | + 4    | Up to 2 Wounds               | +/- 4 |
| 4    | + 6    | Up to 4 Wounds or lost digit | +/- 6 |
| 5    | + 8    | Up to 6 Wounds or lost limb  | +/- 8 |

Example: Fire Blast

1. Fire Magic
2. Two Actions (+4)
3. A Stone's Throw (+3)
4. Instant (+1)
5. Up to 4 targets (+3)
6. 4 Damage (+3)

Target to Beat: 14

Mana Cost for Failure: 9

#### Optional Seventh Ingredient: Descriptors

Lowers the Target to beat by 3, raises the Mana cost for failure by 3.

Descriptors are made up of choice of 3: an adjective (except colors), a shape, a non-shape noun, a number. (Will provide a table soon.)

## Non-Player Entities

All entities have attributes, stats, talents, and skills, though some are played by the referee as an adversary, an ally, an obstacle to overcome, or an object of wonder. NPEs have a rating number to allow referees to gauge their relative power levels to the Players' Entities and to other NPEs. If the players gain a powerful ally, say a dragon, then its important to provide challenging obstacles or adversaries that won't allow the dragon to easily solve everything for them.

As some entities transcend normal abilities, it will not be unusual to use the Extended Ability Table to detail an NPE. It is also possible that NPEs will have a skill rating above 2 for one or more skills.

### NPE Ratings

The rating is the sum of the Ability Modifiers + 1 for each talent if the NPE has more than one, + 1 for each skill with a rating of 2 or more, +1 for each magic item, and the weapon damage - 1.

#### Example

An Ogre has the following attributes, stats, talents, and skills:

Acumen: Low (-2), Agility: Low (-1), Strength: Very High (+4), Tenacity: Average (0)
Stats: MAT: 6, MDR: 4, PAT: 11, PDR: 9 (8 plus 1 from the Talent)
Talent: Durable (Can take 1 extra wound damage)
Skill: Phyisical +1, Survival +2, Great Club +2 damage.

The NPE rating for the Ogre is 2
