## Intro

This is a fantasy roleplaying game. Make it fun.

## Basic Idea

To do anything, you roll a d8, d6, & d4 and add any ability score. One of these dice is a Fate Die, it will determine if you get a boost or a drawback. Roll 11 or more, you succeed. Roll 10 or less, you fail. Regardless of success of failure, if the Fate Die is its maximum value, you get a boost. If it's a 1, you get a drawback.

### Examples

You are fighting something with a sword. Roll d8+d6+d4 + Strength. Your Fate die is a d8:

Roll 11+ and Fate Die is an 8: You strike the target with your sword and they drop their weapon.

Roll 11+ and Fate Die is not an 8: You have struck the target with your sword. 

Roll 11+ and Fate Die is a 1: You have struck the target with your sword, but opened yourself up for an easy counterattack (or you drop your sword).

Roll 10- and Fate Die is an 8: You miss, but quickly whirl around and make a second attempt.

Roll 10- and Fate Die is not an 8: You miss.

Roll 10- and Fate Die is a 1: You miss and fall down from your overswing. (Or you drop your sword.)
