# Equipment & gear

Having the appropriate gear affects (usually in a beneficial way) the chances of succeeding on an action where said gear can help or is required. This is reflected through the use of _modifiers_. A modifier is a number that is added or subtracted from the total dice roll performed by the player. The amount of a modifier is based on the type of equipment being used (for example, the type of weapon used in an attack).
