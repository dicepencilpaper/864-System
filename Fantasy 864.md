# Introduction

Although this game is not expressly written for experienced tabletop players, it's likely that many of you reading this have played role-playing games for years, including various editions of the world's most popular one. If so, you may be asking what makes the 864-System different. If not, rest assured that the answer to that question doesn't require technical jargon or loads of experience. 

This game is intended to provide enough of a framework to enjoy interacting with a fantastic world without reading a two hundred plus page manual. In a group of people playing this game, one is the referee and the others are simply players. The players each control an entity that exists in the game world. After the referee describes a scene, the players use their entities to take action based on what they know. The referee will provide a simple way to determine the success or failure of those actions. From there, the referee describes what happens next and invites the players to join in.

## Entities

An entity is defined as any sentient or semi-sentient inhabitant of the game world. Basically anything that can be considered alive (or pseudo-alive, like undead creatures) is an entity. Players usually direct the same entity throughout play while the referee will direct all other entities. The referee will be the traveler on a road, a wizened sage, a terrifying serpent, and many others encountered in the game.

## What You'll Need

To play with the 864-System, you'll need a few items aside from the booklet of rules:

* At a minimum, three kinds of dice. Specifically one with eight sides, three with six sides, and one die with four sides.
* Pencil and paper to write down everything that describes a player's entity. (You may also decide to use an online word processor for the same purpose.)
* A scene to start the action and get everyone playing.

## Abilities

Abilities define the basic physical and mental characteristics of any sentient or semi-sentient entity. 

- **Acumen (ACU)** - Measures the ability for reasoning and understanding.
- **Agility (AGI)** - Measures physical nimbleness, hand-to-eye coordination and precise handiwork.
- **Strength (STR)** - Measures raw physical strength and power.
- **Tenacity (TEN)** - Measures the entity's mental strength and resilience.

For each of the four abilities, an entity has a rank to measure it. The ranks are **High**, **Average**, and **Low**. The rank determines the dice used to roll for success while playing the game. 

| Rating  | Dice         |
| ------- | ------------ |
| High    | d8 + d6 + d4 |
| Average | d8 + d6      |
| Low     | d8           |

### Ability Modifiers

Ability modifiers are used to determine the value of Stats. 

| Rating | Roll         | Odd Result | Even Result |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| High   | d8 + d6 + d4 | +1         | +2          |
| Low    | d8           | -1         | -2          |

The ability modifier for an ability with Average rating is 0.

### Stats

Stats provide more information about an entity's physical and mental characteristics. Unlike Abilities, Stats are assigned values instead of dice. The four stats are:

- **Mental attack target (MAT)** - Determines the base difficulty to hit the entity with a mental attack.
- **Mental damage resistance (MDR)** - Determines how much mental harm the entity can take.
- **Physical attack target (PAT)** - Determines how easy or difficult it is to hit the entity with a physical attack.
- **Physical damage resistance (PDR)** - Determines how much physical harm the entity can take. 

## Background

Background describes where an entity is from and describes elements of the culture they grew up in. A human entity from a seaside port may know a lot about boats, navigation, and the value of goods and services. An elven entity that grew up on a floating island may know a lot about flying creatures and magical portals. The referee may provide a list of backgrounds or work with players to create their own.

## Talents

Talents represent special abilities an entity possess such as a connection to magic, heightened senses, or other extraordinary abilities.

**Fire Magic** - uses fire

**Conjurer** - conjure horrors

**Alchemy** - makes potions

**Divine Favor** - Cleric

**Astral/Pranic Traveller** - Travel through the Astral Plane (silver cord) or mental projection (golden bowl)

**Melee Master (Swordsman)** - Can attack twice as an action. The second attack is at one attack rank lower.

**Archer** - Like swordsman

**Peltifer** - Casts Wards, Walls, and magical protection spells.

**Defender (Clypean)** - A Martial protector, the opposite of a Melee Master or Archer. Can protect self or others.

**Skapara** - A creator of devices and tools by means of clockwork.

**Travel Magic** - Magic that helps you get from one place to another.

## Skills

Skills represent broad categories of learned abilities. There are five: Survival, Communication, Knowledge, Subterfuge, and Physical. 

**Communication**: The Communication skill represents tasks that involve passing information to another entity through word, sign language, scents, braille, or other means.

**Education**: The Education skill represents tasks that present knowledge gained through instruction or experience.

**Somatic**: The Somatic skill represents tasks that use the physical body. Often this would pertain to athletic actions.

**Subterfuge**: The Subterfuge skill represents tasks that involve deception, misdirection, or sneakiness.

**Survival**: The Survival skill represents outdoor or wilderness tasks such as finding North, foraging, hunting, setting snares, tracking, and finding rare herbs or water. It can also reference urban tasks such as finding a place to sleep in addition to tracking and foraging.

Each skill has the rank of 0, 1, or 2. A rank of zero represents no training or experience with a skill. A rank of one represents proficiency of a skill. A rank of two represents mastery of a skill. An entity can be proficient with up to three skills, but may only attain mastery of one. An entity is required to have a rank of zero in at least two skills.

## Base mechanic

Performing any kind of action with a chance for failure requires a roll based on an ability rating and a skill value against a target number from 1 to 20. The higher the number, the more difficult the action.

### Edge and Hindrance

If an entity has favorable conditions to perform an action, the player will add a d6 to their roll. If an entity has unfavorable conditions, the player will remove a d6 from their roll. If the ability rating is Low, the d8 will be exchanged with a d6 to make the roll.
